My name is Kartikee and I am a physical therapist. I specialize in sports science and have worked with athletes both on and off rehab. My passion for sports and exercise science stems from my own personal experience with injury management.

I believe that everybody should be able to enjoy an active lifestyle, regardless of their age or ability. This is what motivates me to help people overcome their injuries and return to the activities they love.

I am originally from Pune, India but I have also lived in Australia and Cambodia. I have a Bachelors in Physiotherapy from an Indian university. In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, reading books, and travelling."
